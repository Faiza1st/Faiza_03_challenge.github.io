Title :  02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

DISCRIPTION OF THE WEBSITE:
To design a portfolio that meets the expectations of a potential employer, I prioritise several key components that are essential for an impressive presentation:

Introduction Section: When a hiring manager navigates to my portfolio, I make sure my name is prominently displayed, along with a recent photo or avatar. I also provide clearly accessible navigation links that take visitors to sections that include information about myself, my projects, and how to contact me.

Interactive Navigation: I've created an easy-to-use navigation system that responds naturally. When you click on any of the navigation links, the UI effortlessly slides to the respective parts, delivering a pleasant surfing experience.

Work Showcase area: A area dedicated to displaying captioned photos of my apps. By clicking the link for my work, the hiring manager is sent to this area, which provides a visual overview of my projects.

Featured Application Display: I intentionally emphasise the first application among the featured work photographs by showing it in a larger size. This grabs the reader's attention right away, emphasising a specific project that highlights my talents or experience.

Accessibility of Deployed Applications: Clicking on any application picture effortlessly connects the hiring manager to the deployed application. This feature enables users to interact directly with the featured projects, acquiring a better knowledge of my work.

Responsive Design: My portfolio's layout changes to the device or screen size being utilised. A focus is ensuring a seamless and excellent viewing experience across several screens and devices, displaying my dedication to accessibility and user experience.

These standards ensure that my portfolio represents my talents and projects in a thorough, user-friendly, and instructive manner. I hope to give hiring managers with a seamless browsing experience while successfully presenting my expertise by achieving these important requirements.

MAIN ISSUES OF STUGGLE DURING THE PROJECT:
It's been difficult dealing with images and maintaining perfect alignment on my website. I've worked hard to solve these concerns, while my remedies aren't perfect.

Image Management: Managing photos on the website proved difficult. It was difficult to strike a balance between image quality and site loading speed. I tried my best to optimise the photographs by downsizing and compressing them while maintaining a reasonable level of quality. However, establishing the perfect balance between quality and load times is a continuous process.

Alignment Across Devices: Another challenge was getting graphics to line consistently across many devices. Using adaptable design principles was beneficial, but guaranteeing correct alignment on all displays has been a constant challenge. While adopting relative units for size and margins has helped in certain ways, establishing absolute uniformity is still a work in progress.
